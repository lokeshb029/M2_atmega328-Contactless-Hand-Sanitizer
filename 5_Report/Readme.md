# OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT:

An Contactless Hnad Sanitizer is a simple project based on Ultrasonic sensor and atmega328, which is automatically releases the sanitizer by detecting the person's hands.

# INTRODUCTION:

The COVID-19 pandemic has radically affected life for almost everyone around the globe, and makers are no exception.With everyone being more careful of their interactions with humans and objects, personal hygeine has taken serious precendence over all other factors in Public space. A lot of public places have hand sanitizers for visitors, but they need to be manually pressed.

To avoid any contact at all, some no-touch hand sanitizer dispensers are commercially available, but they are expensive and most off-the-shelf commercial sanitizers cannot be automated. In this project , we create a contactless hand sanitizer dispenser that can be used for any press-to-release hand sanitizer available in the market.

The projet used an atmega328 , an HCSR04 Ultrasonic sensor, and a servo motor.The system is adjustable to accomodate most sanitizer bottles. We'll cover the basics of how these sensors work before detailing how to make one of these on your own.

# CATEGORY:

Sensors uses a Reed Switch & Servo Motor to decide the status of the person's hands whether it is near to the sanitizer.

# SENSOR MAINTAINANCE:

Based on this, we can able to use sanitizers without contact, with the help of Ultrasonic sensor and servo motor.

# COMPONENTS AND SUPPLIES:

1.atmega328
2.Servo Motor
3.Ultrasonic Sensor(HRSC04)
4.Switch
5.Potentiometer
6.Cnnecting wires

# ADVANTAGES:

1.Because of their modern appearance, they attract attention which can increase hand hygiene compliance.
2.They deliver a standardized dose of hand soap or sanitizer.
3.They are very easy to install.
4.They eliminate a common contact point where germs can be transferred.
