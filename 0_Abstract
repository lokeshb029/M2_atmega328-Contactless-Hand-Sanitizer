# Abstract

## The COVID-19 pandemic has radically affected life for almost everyone around the globe, and makers are no exception.With everyone being more careful 
of their interactions with humans and objects, personal hygeine has taken serious precendence over all other factors in Public space. A lot of public places
have hand sanitizers for visitors, but they need to be manually pressed.
##To avoid any contact at all, some no-touch hand sanitizer dispensers are commercially available, but they are expensive and most off-the-shelf commercial
sanitizers cannot be automated. In this project , we create a contactless hand sanitizer dispenser that can be used for any press-to-release hand sanitizer
available in the market.
##The projet used an atmega328 , an HCSR04 Ultrasonic sensor, and a servo motor.The system is adjustable to accomodate most sanitizer bottles. We'll cover
the basics of how these sensors work before detailing how to make one of these on your own
